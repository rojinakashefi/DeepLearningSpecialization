### Week 1

- Single number evaluation metric, Satisficing and optimizing metric, Train/Dev/Test Distributions, Size of dev and test sets, When to Change Dev/Rest sets and Metrics, Compare to human-level performace, Avoidable bias, Surpassing human-level performance, Improving your model performance.

### Week 2

- Error analysis, Clearning up Incorrectly labeled data, Build your first system quickly then iterate, Training and Testing on Different Distributions, Bias and Variance with mismatched data distributions, Addressing Data mismatch, Transfer learning, Multi-task learning, End-to-end Deep learning, Wheter to use End-to-End Deep learning.
