    "It is a standard practice in natural language processing tasks to convert sentences into tokens before feeding texts into a language model. Each token is then converted into a numerical vector of fixed length called an embedding, which captures the meaning of the words. In the Transformer architecture, a positional encoding vector is added to the embedding to pass positional information throughout the model. \n",

    "The meaning of these vectors can be difficult to grasp solely by examining the numerical representations, but visualizations can help give some intuition as to the semantic and positional similarity of the words. As you've seen in previous assignments, when embeddings are reduced to two dimensions and plotted, semantically similar words appear closer together, while dissimilar words are plotted farther apart. A similar exercise can be performed with positional encoding vectors - words that are closer in a sentence should appear closer when plotted on a Cartesian plane, and when farther in a sentence, should appear farther on the plane. \n",
